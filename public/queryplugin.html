  <h1>Redirect Based on Query Parameter</h1>
  <p>If a valid "redirect" parameter is found in the query string, you will be redirected to the appropriate website.</p>
This a sample of a page that can effect the desired functionlity for determining whether or not a browser has the Cybotix plugin installed.
A zero-sized ifram calls this page. When the browser loads the ifram, it will also load this page, but not in a way that will affect the user experience
<p>When this URI is called, the http header X_HTTP_CYBOTIX_QUERY_PLUGIN is attached, with a token from Cybotix as the value. 
    This token is customized for triggering a response from the plugin</p>The reponse from the plugin includes the http header "X_HTTP_CYBOTIX_PLUGIN: true"
If there is no such header in the response, the plugin is not present. 
Additional actions can then be taken based on this information.
